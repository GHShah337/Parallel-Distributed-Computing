# Summarry of genetic_algorithm_trial.py
This script solves the shortest route problem using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Here's what it does:
Loads a city distance matrix from a CSV file.
Generates a random population of routes (starting at city 0).
Repeats over multiple generations to improve solutions:
Evaluates fitness (shorter distance = better).
Uses tournament selection to pick parents.
Applies crossover and mutation to create new routes.
Replaces weaker routes with stronger offspring.
If no improvement is seen for several generations, it regenerates the population to escape stagnation.
Finally, it prints the best route and its total distance.
This mimics natural evolution to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the problem

# Question Explanation of my parallalized part
In this assignment, we implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a shortest route optimization problem. The part that was distributed and parallelized using mpi4py was the fitness evaluation of individuals  routes in the population.

# 7 Enhance he algorithm:
1) Added fitness logging (fitness_log.csv) to track improvements over generations.
2) Increased mutation rate dynamically during stagnation to escape local minima.
3) Improved regeneration by keeping only top 5 elites and forcing 40% new random individuals for more exploration.
4) Enhanced selection randomness by increasing tournament size to 5, avoiding selection bias.
5) Enforced unique population and preserved best solutions (elitism), ensuring continuous improvement.

# Q. how to increase car?
To add more cars to the problem, you'd need to modify the genetic representation so that each chromosome encodes multiple routes, one for each car. Instead of a single list of cities (route), you'd represent a solution as a list of multiple sub-routes, partitioned among cars. Then:

1)Update the fitness function to calculate the total distance for all cars combined.
2)Add constraints to ensure each city is visited exactly once, and all cars start and end at the depot.
3)Adjust crossover and mutation operators to handle multi-route chromosomes.
4) Optionally, apply clustering (e.g. K-means) before evolution to group cities by car.
